# Gemini Workspace Rules

## Scratch Directory for Demonstration Code

When generating code for demonstration purposes (e.g., to illustrate a concept or provide a working example), please adhere to the following rule:

- **All demonstration files must be written to the `scratch/` directory. If the scratch directory doesn't exist, create it.**

This ensures that temporary or example files are kept separate from the main project codebase, making them easy to identify and clean up.
